- Backend API: http://localhost:8000

### Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_PORT=3001
```

### Running the Application
1. Navigate to `Frontend/user-dash`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
4. Access at http://localhost:3001

## Integration with Auth App

The dashboard integrates with your existing auth-app in several ways:

1. **User Data Fetching**: Attempts to fetch user data from auth-app API or localStorage
2. **Token Management**: Handles JWT tokens for authenticated API requests
3. **Fallback System**: Uses mock data if auth-app is not available
4. **Seamless Transition**: Users can navigate from auth-app to dashboard

## Key Design Elements

- **Green Theme**: Matching environmental focus with green gradients
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean, modern card designs for different sections
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, transitions, and responsive buttons
- **Icon Integration**: Lucide React icons throughout the interface
- **Statistics Display**: Visual representation of environmental impact
- **Product Showcase**: Green points system for eco-friendly products

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live vehicle tracking
2. **Advanced Maps**: Google Maps or Mapbox integration
3. **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts for pickups and updates
4. **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App features
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed environmental impact charts
6. **Social Features**: Community challenges and achievements

## Current Status
